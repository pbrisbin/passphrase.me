        <h2>How it works

        <ol>
            <li>
                Request integers from 
                <a href="https://www.random.org">random.org
                , which uses things like atmospheric data to generate truly
                random numbers

            <li>
                Use those integers to look up words in 
                <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc">this list
                using 
                <a href="http://digitalcurrencyinstitute.org/how-to-create-super-secure-and-easily-memorable-passphrases/">this approach

            <li>
                Return those words as a simple 
                <code>text/plain
                response

        <h2>Are the passphrases strong?

        <p>
            From the web page for 
            <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/pass_phrase.html">this other generator
            :

        <blockquote>
            The relationship between the number of words in a pass phrase and
            the equivalent number of bits in an encryption key is as follows. We
            must assume [...] that the dictionary from which we choose words is
            known. This dictionary contains 27489 [..] words, so the information
            content of a word chosen randomly from the dictionary is [..] its
            order in the dictionary, 0 to 27488, or log2(27489)â‰ˆ14.75 bits per
            word.

        <p>
            The word list used here has 7,776 entries. This leads to a slightly
            lower bits per word of 12.92. At the default length of 4, you're
            getting ~51 bits.

        <p>
            The inspirational 
            <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd
            comic states it would take a computer 550 years to brute force a
            passphrase with <em>44</em> bits of entropy, so we're doing at least
            that well. If you're concerned, increase the number of words.

        <h2>Is it safe to use this site?

        <p>
            Assuming you trust SSL, yes.

        <p>
            Aside from the word list itself, everything else (the random
            numbers, the generated passphrases) is stored only in memory and
            sent directly and only to you over an SSL connection.

        <p>
            If in doubt, please vet the 
            <a href="https://github.com/pbrisbin/passphrase.me">source code
            yourself.

            Doesn't
            <code>mkpasswd(1)
            do this?

        <p>
            Yes, but it generates gibberish pass<em>words</em>. This is meant to
            generate secure, but memorable pass<em>phrases</em>.
